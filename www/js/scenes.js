In the southern extent of their range, it is uncommon to encounter them lower than 2,500 meters above sea level, but in the northern expanses of their range they can be found at sea level. Overall, they are mainly found at high elevations in cool, moist environments with a ground cover of broken talus rock near montane meadows. This high level of habitat specificity gives their distribution its patchy nature.",
